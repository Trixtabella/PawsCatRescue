                <p>Here are some ways you can help keep your cat happy and reduce the risk of them developing problematic behaviour.</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li class="OMblogbullet"><b>Make sure they can reach everything they need</b> - cats can scare easily, so make sure they can reach everything they need (such as their bed, water, litter or outdoors) without passing things or other animals that may frighten them.</li>
                    <li class="OMblogbullet"><b>Give them some hiding places</b> - if your cat is scared with no place to escape and hide, they may become aggressive. Make sure they have constant access to safe hiding places where they can escape if they feel afraid.</li>
                    <li class="OMblogbullet"><b>Keep them active</b> - cats sleep for many hours of the day, but when they're awake they need opportunities to exercise. If they don't go outside, provide suitable indoor activities to keep them active.</li>
                    <li class="OMblogbullet"><b>Give them toys</b> - play is a good way for your cat to be active and have fun. Provide safe toys and regular opportunities for them to play alone and with people. Puzzle feeders or hiding dried food are both good ways to entertain your cat at meal times.</li>
                    <li class="OMblogbullet"><b>Kindness is key!</b> Never shout at or punish your cat, as they're very unlikely to understand and can become more nervous or scared.</li>
                </ul><img src="./img/feline-fine-paw-prints.png" id="OMpawprints">
                <h3 class="OMBlogTitle">What should cats eat?</h3>
                <p>Cats need a well-balanced, meat-based diet to stay fit and healthy - they can't be vegetarian. You'll need to feed them a diet that's suitable for their age, state of health and lifestyle.</p><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="OMblogbullet"><b>No human food: </b> most typical human food won't meet the nutritional needs of cats, and some human foods can even be poisonous to cats, such as onions.</li>
                        <li class="OMblogbullet"><b>Little and often: </b>cats naturally eat several small meals per day. Make sure you feed your cat every day and try to split their daily intake into several small meals (unless your vet advises otherwise).</li>
                        <li class="OMblogbullet" id="cat-behaviour"><b>Read the instructions: </b>always read and follow the feeding instructions that relate to the cat food you buy.</li>
                        <li class="OMblogbullet"><b>Feed the right amount: </b>the amount your cat needs to eat depends on their age, lifestyle and health, so adjust the amount of food according to their specific needs. If a cat eats more food than they need, they'll become overweight and may suffer. Equally, if they're eating too little, they'll become underweight. </li>
                        <li class="OMblogbullet"><b>If you provide a litter tray, </b>position their food and water well away from it. Most cats won't eat if their food is placed too close to their toilet site.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                <p>Make sure your cat always has clean drinking water available. They need it to stay healthy and could become severely ill within hours without water. Remember, cow's milk isn't a substitute for water.
                Talk to a vet if your cat's eating and drinking habits change - it could be a sign they're ill. </p><img src="./img/feline-fine-paw-prints.png" id="OMpawprints">
                <h3 class="OMBlogTitle">Understanding your cat's behaviour</h3>
                <p>Every cat is unique, but there are signs you can look out for that may suggest there's something not quite right with your cat. As cat owner, it's a good idea to keep a close eye on your cat's behaviour, as any changes could be a sign that they're upset, bored, sick or injured, stressed or frightened. Here's what to look out for and how to keep your cat happy.</p><br><br>
                <p><b>Signs your cat may have a problem</b></p><br>
                <p> If your cat is stressed or afraid you might notice them:</p><br>
                   <ul>
                        <li class="OMblogbullet">Grooming themselves a lot more than usual</li>
                        <li class="OMblogbullet">Hiding</li>
                        <li class="OMblogbullet">Sleeping in a hunched up position</li>
                        <li class="OMblogbullet">Changing their feeding and/or toileting habits</li>
                        <li class="OMblogbullet">Spraying indoors</li>
                    </ul><br>
                   <p id="house-cats">If your cat is in pain or frighterned, you might also notice them:</p><br> 
                    <ul>
                        <li class="OMblogbullet">Adopting new, unwaited habits, such as aggression</li>
                        <li class="OMblogbullet">Disappearing or avoiding people</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <h4>If any of these symptoms become an on-going problem, speak to a vet or clinical animal behaviourist.</h4>

                <h3 class="OMBlogTitle">How to look after house cats</h3>
                <p>Keeping your cat indoors will keep them away from busy roads, but some indoor environments can become predictable and boring, leading to stress, inactivity and obesity. It can be particularly hard for cats to cope with living indoors if they have lots of energy, love to explore and have previously been allowed time outdoors. However, for some cats - such as those with a disability or medical problem - living indoors could be a better option, and they may feel more comfortable.<br>
                    <br>Cats with outdoor access benefit from more opportunities to exhibit natural behaviours like climbing, exploring, roaming their territory and communicating with other cats in the area. That means that an indoor cat will require lots more of your time and effort to be happy and healthy. <br><br>Here's what you'll need to remember:<br>
                    <br><ul>
                        <li class="OMblogbullet"><b>Provide a litter tray in a quiet place</b> and clean it regularly. Cats are often reluctant to use a dirty tray or one located in a busy area.</li>
                        <li class="OMblogbullet"><b>Ensure your cat has enough space</b> - indoor-only cats should have access to several rooms.</li>
                        <li class="OMblogbullet"><b>Give them at least two types of resting place</b> - one at floor level, enclosed on three sides and another higher one with a good view. This should be safe for your cat to access.</li>
                        <li class="OMblogbullet"><b>Provide scratching posts in several locations</b> so they can mark territory, strengthen muscles and sharpen claws.</li>
                        <li class="OMblogbullet"><b>Keep them active</b> - provide opportunities for daily exercise to keep them fit and healthy, and dream up new ways for your cat to stay active, both physically and mentally. Cats can become frustrated and bored with indoor-only lifestyles.</li>
                        <li class="OMblogbullet"><b>Make plenty of time to interact</b> - as your cat won't have the freedom to interact with people/other animals outside, you'll be their main companion.</li>
                        <li class="OMblogbullet"><b>Don't leave them alone too much</b> - you shouldn't leave cats alone for long periods during the day.</li>
